# Contributing to Metada Previewer 
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Make sure your code lints.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License]([http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/fn-Drew/Metadata-Preview/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/fn-Drew/Metadata-Preview/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here's [an example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## License
